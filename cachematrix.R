## I've just modified some line from the example

## It's pretty much do the same as MakeVector but instead of vector and mean
## it will set and get the Matrix and Inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
  
}


## This is also pretty much the same as cacheMean but instead of calculating
## and save the mean it will calculate the inverse and save it.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    i <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(i)) {
      message("getting cached data")
      return(i)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    i <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(i)
    i
  
}
